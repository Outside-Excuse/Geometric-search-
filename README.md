# Geometric-search-
Using the geometric search technique, build a C++ program that implements the algorithm to determine the closest pair of points in a set of points.


Input Format

The program must read a number , that describes the number of points in a set located on a Cartesian plane, followed by  points (one per line). Each line represent a point and it is described by three elements: a name, the , and  coordinate.

Constraints

, followed by  lines, where each element in each line correspond to a name (String) and the coordinates .

Output Format

The output of the program will be the shortest distance (up to 4 decimals with the last digit rounded, not truncated, for example: 1.1661903789690602, then we have with 4 decimals: 1.1662) between two points and the corresponding points.
